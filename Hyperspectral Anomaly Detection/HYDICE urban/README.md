1）HYDICE Dataset [1]: This dataset is an urban scene captured by the airborne sensor named Hyperspectral Digital Imagery Collection Experiment (HYDICE). The spatial resolution and spectral resolution of this dataset can reach 1-m and 10-nm, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4(a), an image subarea with a size of 80×100 pixels and 175 spectral bands is cropped from the original image with a size of 370×370 pixels for the experiments. There are 21 anomalous pixels, which are presented as cars and roofs in complex backgrounds.


2） The first data were collected from the hyperspectral digital imagery collection experiment (HYDICE) with a 10-nm spectral solution and 1-m spatial solution. An image area of 80 × 100 with 175 bands is selected for evaluation as shown in Fig. 2(a). In this image scene, anomalies with 21 pixels consist of vehicles and roofs in different backgrounds, whose specific positions are presented in Fig. 2(b).

3） The second data set urban [see Fig. 3(b)] is a real HSI data collected by the hyperspectral digital imagery collection experiment (HYDICE) remote sensor. There are 210 wavelengths from 400 to 2500 nm. After removing the bands of the water absorption regions and low signal-to-noise ratio, 162 bands were obtained. The size of the entire image is 307 × 307. In our experiment, part of the scene’s image was intercepted, of which the size is 80 × 100 pixels, and vehicles and roofs with 21 pixels were contained as anomalies.

4）The first real dataset is an urban area acquired by the Hyperspectral Digital Imagery Collection Experiment (HYDICE) airborne sensor [2]. It has a spectral resolution of 10 nm and 210 spectral bands spanning wavelengths from 0.4 μm to 2.5 μm. After eliminating the water absorption and low SNR bands, 160 bands are available. The entire scene occupies 307×307 pixels, and a subimage with 80×100 pixels in the upper right corner is cropped for experiments. Some vehicles are considered as anomaly targets in this subimage. False color images of the entire scene and the detection scene as well as the ground-truth map are shown in Fig. 5(a) to Fig. 5(c), respectively.
